A Python-based betting game using Double-Ended Queue (Deque), inspired by the Color Game from Philippine perya.  

ðŸŽ® Features

- Interactive UI â€“ Color-coded visuals, suspenseful animations, and smooth game flow.

About the Project
This project was created during my 2nd year for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It applies key concepts like deques, dynamic memory handling, and algorithmic decision-making in a game-based scenario.
